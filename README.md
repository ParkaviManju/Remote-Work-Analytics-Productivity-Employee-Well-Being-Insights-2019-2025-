Tools: Power BI | Excel | DAX | Power Query | Data Modeling
Domain: HR Analytics | Workforce Analytics | Business Intelligence
________________________________________
🧩 Project Overview
This project analyzes remote, hybrid work models (2019–2025) to understand their impact on employee productivity, departmental performance, stress levels, and work–life balance.
Using Power BI, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to uncover how remote work influences performance and employee well-being, helping organizations make data-driven workforce decisions.

🎯 Project Objectives
1. Analyze Remote Work Trends
Examine trends in Work-From-Home (WFH) adoption over time and identify shifts toward remote and hybrid work models.
2. Evaluate Productivity Impact
Assess whether remote work increases productivity compared to hybrid and remote work environments.
3. Identify Top-Performing Departments
Determine which departments perform best in remote settings using normalized productivity metrics.
4. Understand Employee Well-Being
Analyze stress levels and work–life balance across different work modes.
5. Assess Productivity Drivers
Study the impact of meetings, experience, and work mode on productivity.
